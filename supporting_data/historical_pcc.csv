On 19 June, the humanitarian community in Pakistan was informed that the entire agency of North Waziristan was 'notified' as 'calamity-hit' as per the 1958 National Calamities Act which enabled the Government of Pakistan to register affected people. As a consequence, the overall number of IDPs registered by the Government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan in the impacted area as at 21 July 2014 was 90,836 families/993,166 individuals. They have been sheltered in Pakistan’s districts of Bannu, DI Khan, Lakki Marwat and Karak in the Province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). In addition, an estimated 13,000 families moved across the border to Khost and Paktika provinces of Afghanistan. The military operation in North Waziristan is the last in a succession of operations in the Federally Administrated Tribal Areas (FATA) and Swat that started in 2008. Prior to the operation in June 2014, there were two displacements in February and April. During this period, approximately 22,000 people fled to Afghanistan on each occasion, although it is reported that the majority has since returned to NWA. In May 2014, the Afghanistan Government estimated 500 families, affected by the conflict, crossed the border into Afghanistan. The actual figures assessed were 28 families; all of whom subsequently returned to Pakistan. After the announcement of the full scale operation, the numbers increased significantly. As of 15 July, 12,340 assessed families have crossed the border to Afghanistan (8,692 families in Khost province and 3,648 families in Paktika province). The displaced families who crossed the border into Afghanistan have been sheltered in the provinces of Khost, Paktika, and Paktya, while the Provinces of Nangahar and Kunar continue to be closely monitored for new arrivals. In this Refugee Response Plan, the primary population of concern are the Pakistani families affected by the military operations in North Waziristan who crossed into Afghanistan. In addition, the Response Plan also includes lower numbers of registered Afghan refugees, as well as other Afghans nationals who were compelled to flee back into Afghanistan. Registered Afghans will be in the minority, given the very low number of registered refugees (Proof of Registration card holders) in North Waziristan. Presumably most of the unregistered Afghans in North Waziristan, estimated at some 50,000 people, are from Khost, Paktya, Paktika provinces and are going back and forth as seasonal migrants.",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Afghanistan%20Refugee%20Response%20Plan%20July%20December%202014.pdf

More than 23,200 people have been infected by 15 February 2015, resulting in over 9,300 deaths. Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone are still affected by this outbreak, and are struggling to control the epidemic against a backdrop of extreme poverty, weak health systems and social customs that make breaking human-to-human transmission difficult. For UNHCR, the Ebola epidemic came at a time when the voluntary return of Ivorian refugees from Liberia and Guinea to Côte d’Ivoire was gaining momentum. Return efforts came to a standstill with the declaration of the outbreak at the national, and later international, levels. Instead, UNHCR shifted its priority to ensuring that refugees are integrated into national EVD response plans. During 2014, UNHCR successfully incorporated refugee populations under the national plans in all three affected countries. UNHCR also implemented prevention and preparedness measures in refugee camps. These measures, in place since March 2014, have proven to be effective to date, and refugee camps in Guinea and Liberia have remained Ebola-free, despite the heightened risk of importation from affected surrounding host communities. Nonetheless, national plans face gaps and resource constraints responding effectively in areas hosting refugees. Outside of camps, seven locally-integrated refugees in Sierra Leone and seven urban refugees in Liberia have fallen victim to the disease. From the onset, UNHCR’s interventions have been within the overall UN response plan: initially in line with the WHO’s roadmap, and under the UNMEER coordination mechanism since September 2014. UNHCR’s regional Ebola preparedness and response plan is aligned with the UN System Response Strategy (STEPP) and the WHO roadmap and links to the national response mechanisms. In 2015, UNHCR will continue to focus on the three countries directly affected by EVD (Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone) while simultaneously working on preparedness in the surrounding 11 countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Gambia, Ghana, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, and Togo). UNHCR’s key objectives in these 14 countries are to ensure the preservation of protection space for refugees, asylum-seekers and other populations of concern, and that these populations are included in national response and preparedness plans. The safety of UNHCR staff, implementing partners’ medical staff and community mobilization staff remains of the utmost importance. The funding requested in this supplementary appeal will enable UNHCR to enhance preventive, preparedness and response measures against EVD, participate in the regional and country inter-agency response and ensure continuity of operations, including preparations for the resumption of the voluntary repatriation of Ivorian refugees, in the face of the Ebola crisis.",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Ebola%20Regional%20Response%20Plan%20Jan-Dec%202015%20-%20March%202015.pdf

DRC is party to the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol, and the 1969 AU Convention. In 2002, the DRC adopted a national refugee law, establishing the CNR (Commission Nationale pour les Réfugiés – the National Refugee Commission) to process asylum applications and ensure the protection of refugees. To date, the overall political and security situation in the region remains highly volatile with little prospect for large-scale repatriation. Many of the DRC’s nine neighbouring countries face socio-political instability, while the DRC itself is going through a turbulent period, with a lengthy pre-electoral period complicated by internal conflict, large-scale displacement and a challenging humanitarian and development environment. At the end of 2018, the total refugee population is expected to reach over 546,000, living in communities, in camps, as well as in urban areas.",http://reporting.unhcr.org/sites/default/files/DRC%202019-2020%20Country%20RRP%20%28February%202019%29.pdf

Since mid-2015, a series of political, security and economic developments in Afghanistan have affected its people and forced large numbers out of their homes with, in the last year and a half, over 500,000 people newly displaced within the country. There are now some 1.2 million internally displaced people in Afghanistan. Today, Afghans constitute the second largest group of new arrivals in Europe. The recent developments in Afghanistan have slowed voluntary returns from major hosting countries in the region. In total, less than 59,000 Afghan refugees have opted to return from the Islamic Republics of Iran and Pakistan in 2015. Furthermore, only some 7,500 Afghans have returned during the first half of 2016.  For almost four decades, millions of Afghans have found protection, assistance and temporary solutions in the neighbouring countries thanks to the generosity of the governments and people of the Islamic Republics of Iran and Pakistan. According to current figures, Pakistan hosts some 1.5 million Afghan refugees, holding Proof of Registration Cards and the Islamic Republic of Iran hosts some 951,000 Amayesh card holders . The majority of them are second and third generation refugees living in protracted displacement and with no imminent solutions. Last year, at the request of countries in the region, UNHCR convened a High Level Segment (HLS) on the Afghan refugee situation during the 66th Session of the Executive Committee of the High Commissioner’s Programme. The objective of the segment was to draw global attention to the slow progress achieved in addressing this protracted situation and encourage support from the international community. The Solutions Strategy for Afghan Refugees to Support Voluntary Repatriation, Sustainable Reintegration and Assistance to Host Countries (SSAR), developed by the Governments of the Islamic Republics of Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan, and UNHCR has provided the overall framework for Afghan refugees in the region since 2012. 2 Member states participating at the HLS reaffirmed the validity of the SSAR and recognized the critical role played by host countries in the region. The HLS also called for increased international solidarity and responsibility-sharing to address the protracted situation, including greater financial and political support to reinforce the resilience of refugees and host communities and to find durable solutions for Afghan refugees.  The Islamic Republics of Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan have been strong supporters of the SSAR and regularly participate in tripartite and quadripartite meetings with UNHCR to coordinate solutions for Afghan refugees. However, there are serious concerns about the limited prospects for return to Afghanistan and the decreasing support of the international community for the Afghan refugee situation. Inside Afghanistan, the situation remains precarious. The National Unity Government, formed in 2014, showed strong commitment to address issues related to displacement and placed it among its highest national priorities. This included the formation of the High Commission on Migration, chaired by the President, to address key issues relating to Afghan refugees, returnees and internally displaced people. The Government developed a national Comprehensive Voluntary Repatriation and Reintegration Strategy with UNHCR’s support and in coordination with the Governments of the Islamic Republics of Iran and Pakistan through the tripartite commission framework. Despite these positive developments, since mid-2015 the security situation in most parts of Afghanistan has been rapidly deteriorating. It has seen the highest civilian casualties recorded since 2009 (11,002 people), alongside an unprecedented number of conflict-affected IDPs today totalling 1.2 million. The country continues to face serious challenges in its nation-building and in addressing complex security issues. The situation is further exacerbated by economic challenges and slow progress in the implementation of development programmes. At the same time, the humanitarian community is severely constrained in addressing the country’s growing needs due to increasing insecurity, narrowing humanitarian space, and dwindling resources. The waning hope of many Afghans for their country’s political and economic future is driving people out of the country, many of them to the Islamic Republic of Iran and Pakistan. Many have also tried to reach Europe, hoping to find protection and opportunities for better lives for themselves and their families. Representing some 20 per cent, Afghans are ranked the second largest group of new arrivals in the Mediterranean since the beginning of 2016, roughly equivalent to that of 2015. The movement toward Europe is also reported to include Afghans who transited or resided in the Islamic Republic of Iran. In particular, younger refugees, many of whom were born in exile, find it difficult to relate to Afghanistan and believe they will have better educational and economic prospects in European countries.",http://reporting.unhcr.org/sites/default/files/UNHCR%20Regional%20Plan%20-%20Building%20resilience%20%26%20solutions%20Afghan%20refugees%20in%20SWA%201JUL16-31DEC17.pdf

Since mid-2015, a series of political, security and economic developments in Afghanistan have affected its people and forced large numbers out of their homes with, in the last year and a half, over 500,000 people newly displaced within the country. There are now some 1.2 million internally displaced people in Afghanistan. Today, Afghans constitute the second largest group of new arrivals in Europe. The recent developments in Afghanistan have slowed voluntary returns from major hosting countries in the region. In total, less than 59,000 Afghan refugees have opted to return from the Islamic Republics of Iran and Pakistan in 2015. Furthermore, only some 7,500 Afghans have returned during the first half of 2016.  For almost four decades, millions of Afghans have found protection, assistance and temporary solutions in the neighbouring countries thanks to the generosity of the governments and people of the Islamic Republics of Iran and Pakistan. According to current figures, Pakistan hosts some 1.5 million Afghan refugees, holding Proof of Registration Cards and the Islamic Republic of Iran hosts some 951,000 Amayesh card holders . The majority of them are second and third generation refugees living in protracted displacement and with no imminent solutions. Last year, at the request of countries in the region, UNHCR convened a High Level Segment (HLS) on the Afghan refugee situation during the 66th Session of the Executive Committee of the High Commissioner’s Programme. The objective of the segment was to draw global attention to the slow progress achieved in addressing this protracted situation and encourage support from the international community. The Solutions Strategy for Afghan Refugees to Support Voluntary Repatriation, Sustainable Reintegration and Assistance to Host Countries (SSAR), developed by the Governments of the Islamic Republics of Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan, and UNHCR has provided the overall framework for Afghan refugees in the region since 2012. 2 Member states participating at the HLS reaffirmed the validity of the SSAR and recognized the critical role played by host countries in the region. The HLS also called for increased international solidarity and responsibility-sharing to address the protracted situation, including greater financial and political support to reinforce the resilience of refugees and host communities and to find durable solutions for Afghan refugees.  The Islamic Republics of Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan have been strong supporters of the SSAR and regularly participate in tripartite and quadripartite meetings with UNHCR to coordinate solutions for Afghan refugees.

2016,Afghanistan,AF,Afghanistan,Supplementary Appeals,SPA,Repatriation of Afghan Refugees from Pakistan - Revised Supplementary Appeal,"259,233,865",,,"The scale and pace of Afghan returns from Pakistan is accelerating to an unprecedented rate, aggravated by the humanitarian challenges of winter months. Refugees are often returning to areas with limited absorption capacity. Combined with increasing levels of displacement and continuing economic difficulties faced by vulnerable local populations, multiple humanitarian needs are outstripping international capacity to assist. On 19 September 2016 UNHCR issued a Supplementary Appeal for $104.7 million to support 221,000 refugee returnees from Pakistan with repatriation cash grants and enhanced protection monitoring and interventions, as well as processing at the Voluntary Repatriation Centres (VRCs) in Pakistan. Since the publication of that Supplementary Appeal, the pace of repatriation from Pakistan has accelerated, with the added risks of humanitarian impact on already vulnerable people and communities in Afghanistan ahead of winter. This revision to the initial Supplementary Appeal reflects the latest developments, and highlights urgent priority actions that need immediate funding. It reflects increased needs as a result of the increased numbers of refugees returning from Pakistan, and to support the most vulnerable returnees, IDPs and local population in Afghanistan. As of 20 October 2016, almost 270,000 refugees had returned to Afghanistan, almost exclusively from Pakistan. This already surpassed the annual projection presented in the initial Supplementary Appeal. This revised Supplementary Appeal presents the additional financial requirements to support 365,000 refugee returnees and winterization for vulnerable returnees, IDPs and host community population. The revised financial requirements total $181.2 million, up from the $104 million presented in September’s Supplementary Appeal. In light of the exponential pace and volume of returns, UNHCR finds itself critically short of the funding to carry on providing repatriation grants to refugee returnees. To make up for this funding shortfall, it has been re-allocating and reprioritizing resources within Afghanistan and from other operations. Unless further resources are made available, UNHCR will be obliged to suspend the provision of repatriation cash grants in the coming days.

2016,Burundi,BI,Burundi,Supplementary Appeals,SPA,Burundi Situation 2016 Supplementary Appeal,"34,538,842",,,"In May 2015, the Constitutional Court of Burundi approved President Pierre Nkurunziza’s bid for a third term, triggering weeks of protests mainly in the capital, Bujumbura. Ahead of the elections, a spiral of violence forced thousands of fearful Burundians to flee their homes. Following President Nkurunziza’s electoral victory in July 2015, the situation further deteriorated with the escalation of clashes between protestors and supporters of the ruling party, as well as with police forces. Efforts to broker dialogue between the various parties have been ineffectual and reports of human rights violations have increased; humanitarian actors have reported the deaths of more than 400 people, including aid workers, since April 2015. An interagency regional Refugee Response Plan (RRP) and a UNHCR supplementary appeal were launched in 2015 as planning, coordination and fundraising platforms for the emergency response to the massive influx of new Burundian asylum-seekers. Tensions remain high in the capital, Bujumbura, as well as in the provinces of Bururi, Makamba and Rumonge. Consequently, Burundians continue to seek asylum in neighbouring countries. By 1 June 5 2016, the crisis in Burundi had forced over 267,000 people to flee to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Rwanda, Uganda, the United Republic of Tanzania, and Zambia. In light of the prevailing situation inside Burundi, it is projected that another 76,000 people will likely seek asylum by the end of 2016, bringing the total to 343,000 refugees since April 2015. In parallel, the Government of Burundi reported that 36,000 Burundians returned from Tanzania last May, of whom 2,500 have been verified as refugees registered by UNHCR in Tanzania. It is expected that 50,000 will return spontaneously by the end of 2016, although conditions are not conducive to their return, and will also require assistance to reintegrate. Finally, some 41,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) have so far been identified in IOM’s Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM), covering five provinces of the country. This revised supplementary appeal for the Burundi situation (January-December 2016) presents UNHCR’s additional requirements to respond to the needs of Burundian refugees, returnees and IDPs in 2016, and amount to a total of USD 180 million as detailed in the financial summary table below.",http://reporting.unhcr.org/sites/default/files/UNHCR%20Burundi%20Situation%20Revised%20SB%20Appeal%20Jan-Dec2016%20-%20July%202016.pdf
2016,Belize,BZ,Belize,Supplementary Appeals,SPA,Regional Response to the Northern Triangle of Central America,"1,635,438",,,"This supplementary appeal is presented as a follow-up of the Protection and Solutions Strategy for the Northern Triangle of Central America (NTCA) launched in December 2015. It outlines UNHCR’s protection and solutions interventions planned for 2016 to respond to additional and most urgent needs of refugees, asylum-seekers, returnees and internally displaced people from the NTCA in countries of origin, transit and asylum, encompassing Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Panama. In recent years, NTCA countries – El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras – have seen a dramatic escalation in violence by organized criminal groups. Current homicide rates are among the highest ever recorded in the region and are as deadly as many contemporary armed conflicts. Sexual violence is also prevalent, with the overwhelming majority of victims being girls between the ages of 10 and 19 years. Disappearances, forced recruitment into gangs, and the sexual exploitation of girls and women also form part of the pattern of violence. The extraordinary epidemic of violence is compelling a diverse range of people to flee their homes and to seek international protection, particularly in bordering and nearby countries. In 2015, asylum applications from NTCA citizens reached 54,877 in the region, nearly double the number lodged in 2014 (28,752), while the number of recognized refugees reached 31,219 – a 41 per cent increase over 2014. The majority of the NTCA refugee population is in the United States of America, with a significant and increasing presence in Belize, Costa Rica and Mexico, as well as to a lesser but still significant extent in Nicaragua and Panama. Among those fleeing are growing numbers of women and girls and unaccompanied and separated children who are particularly vulnerable to sexual assault, human trafficking and other protection risks during displacement. The capacity of certain gangs and organized criminal groups in the NTCA to act transnationally generates a risk of continuing persecution for NTCA asylum-seekers and refugees. Protection risks are also high for certain refugees profiles, such as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) people, among others. In 2015, more than 230,000 NTCA citizens were apprehended by authorities and returned1 to their countries of origin, reportedly mainly from the United States and Mexico. This number has been in constant upward trend in the last five years, progressively resulting in a two-fold increase compared to the 2011 baseline. Many returnees who fled violence fear returning to their neighbourhoods and become internally displaced. Some returnees have been identified by gangs near reception centres and elsewhere in countries of origin, and have been killed shortly after return.  Forced internal displacement due to the violence in the NTCA also appears widespread, although data is fragmented. In Honduras, in just 20 out of some 300 municipalities, the Government identified 174,000 people displaced due to violence between 2004 and 2014, representing some 4 per cent of the population. Most internally displaced people (IDPs) are almost invisible victims of the violence, lone individuals and families who leave their communities discreetly and keep a low profile to avoid drawing the attention of their persecutors. The widespread protection risks for asylum-seekers, refugees, returnees and IDPs require an urgent, strategic and regional response in close coordination with all relevant stakeholders, and UNHCR appeals to its donors for urgent financial support to meet the needs of up to 570,000 people of concern.

2016,Mexico,MX,Mexico,Supplementary Appeals,SPA,Regional Response to the Northern Triangle of Central America,"12,365,837",,,"This supplementary appeal is presented as a follow-up of the Protection and Solutions Strategy for the Northern Triangle of Central America (NTCA) launched in December 2015. It outlines UNHCR’s protection and solutions interventions planned for 2016 to respond to additional and most urgent needs of refugees, asylum-seekers, returnees and internally displaced people from the NTCA in countries of origin, transit and asylum, encompassing Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Panama. In recent years, NTCA countries – El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras – have seen a dramatic escalation in violence by organized criminal groups. Current homicide rates are among the highest ever recorded in the region and are as deadly as many contemporary armed conflicts. Sexual violence is also prevalent, with the overwhelming majority of victims being girls between the ages of 10 and 19 years. Disappearances, forced recruitment into gangs, and the sexual exploitation of girls and women also form part of the pattern of violence. The extraordinary epidemic of violence is compelling a diverse range of people to flee their homes and to seek international protection, particularly in bordering and nearby countries. In 2015, asylum applications from NTCA citizens reached 54,877 in the region, nearly double the number lodged in 2014 (28,752), while the number of recognized refugees reached 31,219 – a 41 per cent increase over 2014. The majority of the NTCA refugee population is in the United States of America, with a significant and increasing presence in Belize, Costa Rica and Mexico, as well as to a lesser but still significant extent in Nicaragua and Panama. Among those fleeing are growing numbers of women and girls and unaccompanied and separated children who are particularly vulnerable to sexual assault, human trafficking and other protection risks during displacement. The capacity of certain gangs and organized criminal groups in the NTCA to act transnationally generates a risk of continuing persecution for NTCA asylum-seekers and refugees. Protection risks are also high for certain refugees profiles, such as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) people, among others. In 2015, more than 230,000 NTCA citizens were apprehended by authorities and returned1 to their countries of origin, reportedly mainly from the United States and Mexico. This number has been in constant upward trend in the last five years, progressively resulting in a two-fold increase compared to the 2011 baseline. Many returnees who fled violence fear returning to their neighbourhoods and become internally displaced. Some returnees have been identified by gangs near reception centres and elsewhere in countries of origin, and have been killed shortly after return.  Forced internal displacement due to the violence in the NTCA also appears widespread, although data is fragmented. In Honduras, in just 20 out of some 300 municipalities, the Government identified 174,000 people displaced due to violence between 2004 and 2014, representing some 4 per cent of the population. Most internally displaced people (IDPs) are almost invisible victims of the violence, lone individuals and families who leave their communities discreetly and keep a low profile to avoid drawing the attention of their persecutors. The widespread protection risks for asylum-seekers, refugees, returnees and IDPs require an urgent, strategic and regional response in close coordination with all relevant stakeholders, and UNHCR appeals to its donors for urgent financial support to meet the needs of up to 570,000 people of concern.

2016,Nigeria,NG,Nigeria,Supplementary Appeals,SPA,UNHCR Scale-up Response Plan for Northeast Nigeria 2016 Supplementary Appeal,"40,906,967",,,"This Supplementary Appeal reflects the extent of the humanitarian needs in Nigeria, some of which have become apparent in the last several weeks. It outlines UNHCR’s scale up plan and consequent funding requirements to meet the increased humanitarian and protection needs of displaced individuals both inside the country, who have been without access to assistance since the beginning of the conflict, and of refugees returning from neighbouring countries. Building on existing Government resources and capacities, UNHCR will support the Government-led response, in particular by the National and State Emergency Management Agencies (NEMA/SEMA), in line with the Government’s plan for rebuilding the northeast (Buhari Plan) announced in June 2016. Activities planned under this Appeal are also aligned with the United Nations Scale-up Plan for northeast Nigeria, coordinated by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and based on the individual agencies’ scale-up plans to meet priority sectoral needs for internally displaced populations (IDPs) and their host communities. The 2016 Regional Refugee Response Plan (Regional RRP) for the Nigeria situation will remain the main coordination and planning tool to cater for the protection and life-saving needs of Nigerian refugees living in Cameroon, Niger and Chad. Since January 2016, counter-insurgency operations launched by the Nigerian security forces, in cooperation with the Multi-National Joint Task Force, have intensified against the extremist group Boko Haram. The army has reclaimed many of the main towns and villages in Borno, Yobe, and Adamawa States in northeast Nigeria, enabling access and revealing the full effects of the conflict on civilian populations. The security situation remains fragile with sporadic insurgent attacks severely impacting on humanitarian needs, access and response priorities. As the military continues to recapture territory and secure civilian locations, more areas are expected to become accessible to humanitarian organisations in the coming months. According to the latest Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) report of August 2016 released by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), an estimated 1.87 million people have been internally displaced by the Boko Haram insurgency in the northeast, 77 per cent of whom are hosted in Borno State. In recent weeks, access to previously inaccessible areas in Borno and Yobe States has allowed humanitarian agencies to identify up to an estimated 800,000 IDPs in dire conditions and requiring urgent lifesaving assistance. While the Nigerian security forces have significantly reduced the areas under Boko Haram’s control, the civilian population in Borno State remains the most vulnerable to violence, which mostly affects women and children. The conflict has been marked by multiple and grave violations of human rights and humanitarian law, including death, injury, sexual violence and exploitation, detention, disappearances, attacks on civilian sites and forced recruitment. In newly accessible areas of Borno, the rule of law remains a challenge owing to the limited presence of civil administration, police and other law enforcement agencies. With only military and security forces present due to continued active combat and resulting security restrictions, camp coordination and camp management (CCCM) and humanitarian assistance in the IDP camps are delivered mainly under the auspices of military personnel, with resulting constraints on humanitarian space. Significant numbers of Nigerian refugees have returned from neighbouring countries of asylum, sometimes under circumstances deemed by UNHCR to be inconsistent with international law. An estimated 106,000 returnees have gone back to accessible and non-accessible areas, some of whom are in IDP or IDP-like settings and are in need of registration services, and reintegration assistance such as shelter, protection-based material assistance and psycho-social support. This number includes an estimated 67,000 identified in newly accessible areas of Borno State, and who are staying in abandoned public buildings largely destroyed by Boko Haram. With around 81 per cent of IDPs living in host communities, resources are being depleted and services severely strained. IDPs and returnees hosted in camps and displacement sites are often living in congested shelters or isolated in insecure or inhospitable areas, making them vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. Protection monitoring visits conducted by UNHCR in IDP sites in Borno revealed challenges related to access to water and sanitation facilities, shelter and freedom of movement in and around camps, limited access to medical care, and dire food shortages. Although most IDPs reportedly wish to return to their areas of habitual residence, conditions are not yet conducive for voluntary, safe and dignified return. Furthermore, the insurgency and related displacement continue to negatively affect livelihood opportunities. Affected households have had consecutive years of restricted income levels, destruction of assets and livelihoods, and reduced food access, leading to increasing trend of negative coping strategies. The number of people in need of food assistance in north-eastern Nigeria has risen to 4.4 million as at August 2016, according to the Food Security Sector. The additional financial requirements requested in this Appeal will enable a rapid scale up of UNHCR operations initially until the end of 2016, and thus contribute to a holistic and targeted protection and assistance response in newly accessible Local Government Areas (LGAs) in northeast Nigeria. These requirements are expected to go into 2017 and may be the subject of an additional Supplementary Appeal.",http://reporting.unhcr.org/sites/default/files/UNHCR%20Scale-up%20Response%20Plan%20for%20Northeast%20Nigeria%20SB%20-%20Aug-Dec.%202016%20--%20September%202016.pdf

Given the recent security and political gains observed in parts of Somalia, and in the context of the Government of Kenya’s decision to close the Dadaab refugee camps, the Tripartite Commission for the Voluntary Repatriation of Somali Refugees living in Kenya met in Nairobi on 25 June 2016 to discuss the operational modalities of ensuring a safe, dignified, voluntary return and sustainable reintegration of Somali refugees from Kenya. An Enhanced Plan of Action for the Voluntary Return and Reintegration of Somali Refugees from the Dadaab Camps in Kenya (hereinafter “the Plan”) was proposed by UNHCR to address the concerns expressed by the Government of Kenya, while ensuring that returns take place voluntarily and in conditions of safety and dignity as set out in International Law and reiterated in the Tripartite Agreement Governing the Voluntary Repatriation of Somali Refugees living in Kenya, signed by UNHCR and the Governments of Kenya and Somalia in November 2013.",http://reporting.unhcr.org/sites/default/files/UNHCR%20Somalia%20Situation%20SB%20Appeal%20Jan-Dec2016%20-%20July%202016.pdf

In addition to this outflow, a further 120,000 South Sudanese who never returned after the end of the 20-year civil war remain refugees in Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda, as do an estimated 350,000 South Sudanese who remained in Sudan after South  Sudan’s independence in 2011. Population outflows have continued despite the signing in August 2015 of the agreement brokered by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan, and the subsequent formation at the end of May 2016 of the Transitional Government of National Unity in South Sudan. These outflows resulted in a revision of the South Sudan Regional Refugee Response Plan (RRP) and the creation of a UNHCR Supplementary Appeal for the South Sudan Situation in July 2016. Shortly after the finalisation of this Supplementary Appeal, however, renewed fighting in Juba, South Sudan triggered another mass outflow of South Sudanese people. Since 7 July, over 120,000 people have fled to neighbouring countries, mostly to Uganda. This influx has exceeded Uganda’s end of year planning figure of potential refugees from South Sudan. The significant population upsurge in Uganda of over 70,000 South Sudanese refugees since the beginning of July and increase in their associated humanitarian needs has prompted a second revision of the Uganda country chapter of the 2016 South Sudan Regional RRP and the UNHCR Supplementary Appeal in August 2016.

Virtually the entire country is affected by the ongoing conflict and humanitarian needs have increased exponentially, resulting in 80 per cent of the population being in need of some form of humanitarian assistance. More than 2.5 million people – around 10 per cent of the total population – are internally displaced as of 30 November 2015. Prior to the crisis, Yemen was hosting more than 263,900 refugees, the majority from Somalia, who require continued protection and assistance. Notwithstanding the ongoing conflict in Yemen, refugees, asylum-seekers and vulnerable migrants, the majority from Ethiopia and Somalia, have continued to arrive in Yemen in search of protection or to transit onwards to the Arabian Peninsula. In 2015 alone, 92,446 new arrivals reached Yemeni shores. Alongside internal displacement, people are fleeing the country in considerable numbers. By the end of 2015, more than 99,000 persons of concern from Yemen had been reported in countries in the East and Horn of Africa, mainly in Djibouti, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan, as well as in the Gulf region. As the situation in Yemen continues to deteriorate, and based on recent trends, it is anticipated that movements to the East and Horn of Africa, the Gulf States, and beyond will continue at similar rates in 2016. Following the system-wide L3 emergency declaration for Yemen on 1 July 2015, UNHCR declared the Yemen situation an internal level 3 emergency and designated a Regional Refugee Coordinator (RRC) for the Yemen situation under the Refugee Coordination Model. The RRC ensures coherent and coordinated support on the ground for UNHCR’s response to the overall regional dimensions of the Yemen crisis. The RRC works closely with IOM and other humanitarian agencies and partners to strengthen UNHCR’s leadership and coordination role for the refugee response, and maximizes collaboration and synergies with other partners at the regional level.
This supplementary appeal outlines UNHCR’s planned response to the Yemen emergency in 2016. It covers the needs of refugees and asylum-seekers of various nationalities in Yemen, internally displaced people (IDPs) and others in Yemen who are part of mixed movements. It also presents UNHCR’s response to the needs of refugees fleeing Yemen to the East and Horn of Africa and the Middle East and North Africa. In December 2015, UNHCR together with IOM launched an inter-agency Regional Refugee and Migrant Response Plan (RRMRP), covering the requirements to provide protection and assistance to those fleeing Yemen into Djibouti, Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan for January-December 2016. UNHCR’s response to the Yemen situation in Djibouti, Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan as presented in this supplementary appeal is in line with the RRMRP.",http://reporting.unhcr.org/sites/default/files/UNHCR%20Yemen%20Situation%202016%20Supplementary%20Appeal%20Feb%202016.pdf
2016,Zambia,ZM,Zambia,Supplementary Appeals,SPA,Burundi Situation 2016 Supplementary Appeal,"17,460,761",,,"In May 2015, the Constitutional Court of Burundi approved President Pierre Nkurunziza’s bid for a third term, triggering weeks of protests mainly in the capital, Bujumbura. Ahead of the elections, a spiral of violence forced thousands of fearful Burundians to flee their homes. Following President Nkurunziza’s electoral victory in July 2015, the situation further deteriorated with the escalation of clashes between protestors and supporters of the ruling party, as well as with police forces. Efforts to broker dialogue between the various parties have been ineffectual and reports of human rights violations have increased; humanitarian actors have reported the deaths of more than 400 people, including aid workers, since April 2015. An interagency regional Refugee Response Plan (RRP) and a UNHCR supplementary appeal were launched in 2015 as planning, coordination and fundraising platforms for the emergency response to the massive influx of new Burundian asylum-seekers. Tensions remain high in the capital, Bujumbura, as well as in the provinces of Bururi, Makamba and Rumonge. Consequently, Burundians continue to seek asylum in neighbouring countries. By 1 June 5 2016, the crisis in Burundi had forced over 267,000 people to flee to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Rwanda, Uganda, the United Republic of Tanzania, and Zambia. In light of the prevailing situation inside Burundi, it is projected that another 76,000 people will likely seek asylum by the end of 2016, bringing the total to 343,000 refugees since April 2015. In parallel, the Government of Burundi reported that 36,000 Burundians returned from Tanzania last May, of whom 2,500 have been verified as refugees registered by UNHCR in Tanzania. It is expected that 50,000 will return spontaneously by the end of 2016, although conditions are not conducive to their return, and will also require assistance to reintegrate. Finally, some 41,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) have so far been identified in IOM’s Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM), covering five provinces of the country. This revised supplementary appeal for the Burundi situation (January-December 2016) presents UNHCR’s additional requirements to respond to the needs of Burundian refugees, returnees and IDPs in 2016, and amount to a total of USD 180 million as detailed in the financial summary table below.",http://reporting.unhcr.org/sites/default/files/UNHCR%20Burundi%20Situation%20Revised%20SB%20Appeal%20Jan-Dec2016%20-%20July%202016.pdf

DRC is party to the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol, and the 1969 AU Convention. In 2002, the DRC adopted a national refugee law, establishing the CNR (Commission Nationale pour les Réfugiés – the National Refugee Commission) to process asylum applications and ensure the protection of refugees. To date, the overall political and security situation in the region remains highly volatile with little prospect for large-scale repatriation. Many of the DRC’s nine neighbouring countries face socio-political instability, while the DRC itself is going through a turbulent period, with a lengthy pre-electoral period complicated by internal conflict, large-scale displacement and a challenging humanitarian and development environment. At the end of 2018, the total refugee population is expected to reach over 546,000, living in communities, in camps, as well as in urban areas.",http://reporting.unhcr.org/sites/default/files/DRC%202019-2020%20Country%20RRP%20%28February%202019%29.pdf

Since mid-2015, a series of political, security and economic developments in Afghanistan have affected its people and forced large numbers out of their homes with, in the last year and a half, over 500,000 people newly displaced within the country. There are now some 1.2 million internally displaced people in Afghanistan. Today, Afghans constitute the second largest group of new arrivals in Europe. The recent developments in Afghanistan have slowed voluntary returns from major hosting countries in the region. In total, less than 59,000 Afghan refugees have opted to return from the Islamic Republics of Iran and Pakistan in 2015. Furthermore, only some 7,500 Afghans have returned during the first half of 2016.  For almost four decades, millions of Afghans have found protection, assistance and temporary solutions in the neighbouring countries thanks to the generosity of the governments and people of the Islamic Republics of Iran and Pakistan. According to current figures, Pakistan hosts some 1.5 million Afghan refugees, holding Proof of Registration Cards and the Islamic Republic of Iran hosts some 951,000 Amayesh card holders . The majority of them are second and third generation refugees living in protracted displacement and with no imminent solutions. Last year, at the request of countries in the region, UNHCR convened a High Level Segment (HLS) on the Afghan refugee situation during the 66th Session of the Executive Committee of the High Commissioner’s Programme. The objective of the segment was to draw global attention to the slow progress achieved in addressing this protracted situation and encourage support from the international community. The Solutions Strategy for Afghan Refugees to Support Voluntary Repatriation, Sustainable Reintegration and Assistance to Host Countries (SSAR), developed by the Governments of the Islamic Republics of Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan, and UNHCR has provided the overall framework for Afghan refugees in the region since 2012. 2 Member states participating at the HLS reaffirmed the validity of the SSAR and recognized the critical role played by host countries in the region. The HLS also called for increased international solidarity and responsibility-sharing to address the protracted situation, including greater financial and political support to reinforce the resilience of refugees and host communities and to find durable solutions for Afghan refugees.  The Islamic Republics of Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan have been strong supporters of the SSAR and regularly participate in tripartite and quadripartite meetings with UNHCR to coordinate solutions for Afghan refugees. However, there are serious concerns about the limited prospects for return to Afghanistan and the decreasing support of the international community for the Afghan refugee situation. Inside Afghanistan, the situation remains precarious. The National Unity Government, formed in 2014, showed strong commitment to address issues related to displacement and placed it among its highest national priorities. This included the formation of the High Commission on Migration, chaired by the President, to address key issues relating to Afghan refugees, returnees and internally displaced people. The Government developed a national Comprehensive Voluntary Repatriation and Reintegration Strategy with UNHCR’s support and in coordination with the Governments of the Islamic Republics of Iran and Pakistan through the tripartite commission framework. Despite these positive developments, since mid-2015 the security situation in most parts of Afghanistan has been rapidly deteriorating. It has seen the highest civilian casualties recorded since 2009 (11,002 people), alongside an unprecedented number of conflict-affected IDPs today totalling 1.2 million. The country continues to face serious challenges in its nation-building and in addressing complex security issues. The situation is further exacerbated by economic challenges and slow progress in the implementation of development programmes. At the same time, the humanitarian community is severely constrained in addressing the country’s growing needs due to increasing insecurity, narrowing humanitarian space, and dwindling resources. The waning hope of many Afghans for their country’s political and economic future is driving people out of the country, many of them to the Islamic Republic of Iran and Pakistan. Many have also tried to reach Europe, hoping to find protection and opportunities for better lives for themselves and their families. Representing some 20 per cent, Afghans are ranked the second largest group of new arrivals in the Mediterranean since the beginning of 2016, roughly equivalent to that of 2015. The movement toward Europe is also reported to include Afghans who transited or resided in the Islamic Republic of Iran. In particular, younger refugees, many of whom were born in exile, find it difficult to relate to Afghanistan and believe they will have better educational and economic prospects in European countries.",http://reporting.unhcr.org/sites/default/files/UNHCR%20Regional%20Plan%20-%20Building%20resilience%20%26%20solutions%20Afghan%20refugees%20in%20SWA%201JUL16-31DEC17.pdf

As of the end of April 2017, more than 420,600 Burundian refugees had fled to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Rwanda, Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania, with over 120,000 having fled to these countries in 2016. While many seek refuge abroad, internal displacement remains relatively low despite a potentially explosive situation within the country, with worsening humanitarian and socio-economic indicators. The human rights situation inside Burundi is volatile. Refugees fleeing Burundi have reported human rights abuses, fear of persecution, and sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) as some of the reasons for their flight. International efforts at encouraging dialogue towards a resolution of the crisis have stalled. As the overall political and economic situation remains fragile with no signs of improving in 2017, it is expected that people will continue to flee to neighbouring countries, mostly to the United Republic of Tanzania, where some 249,000 refugees are already accommodated in three camps, namely Mtendeli, Nduta and Nyarugusu.

Security in South Sudan continues to deteriorate and close to four million people—one-third of the total population—are displaced. More than 1.7 million South Sudanese have fled the country and an estimated 7.5 million people are in need of urgent humanitarian assistance inside South Sudan, including more than 1.9 million internally displaced people (IDPs). Recent and continuing violence has generated new displacement, in particular in the Eastern Equatoria region and Western Bahr el Ghazal. The potential for further conflict in border areas persists, in particular in light of growing and widespread food insecurity, and with close to five million people in need of life-saving food assistance. Famine in parts of South Sudan is an increasingly likely scenario, and humanitarian actors have reported that an estimated 100,000 people are already affected by it in parts of former Unity State. One million children under five years of age are estimated to be acutely malnourished across the country, including 270,000 children who face the imminent risk of death should they not be reached in time with assistance. Protracted instability, brutal conflict and food insecurity are further compounded by a cholera outbreak which has spread to 12 counties in 32 states country-wide. The majority of South Sudanese refugees have sought safety in Uganda. By the end of March 2017, the country was hosting 852,300 South Sudanese refugees and is struggling to cope with the ever-increasing needs. Some 195,000 South Sudanese arrived in the first three months of 2017 alone, an average rate of 2,000 refugees each day. Over 60 per cent of the new arrivals are children. An estimated 400,000 new arrivals from South Sudan are expected to enter Uganda in 2017. The Government of Uganda has maintained open borders and one of the most progressive refugee policies in Africa, promoting self-reliance of refugees and peaceful co-existence with host communities. However, urgent and massive support is needed to respond to the critical situation. Host communities and humanitarian agencies are struggling to feed and shelter the refugee arrivals and provide basic services. Providing access to safe drinking water remains an urgent priority in the dry lands of northern Uganda where refugees are hosted. By the end of March 2017, refugees also continued to arrive in the neighbouring countries of Central African Republic (CAR; 1,600), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC; 74,100), Ethiopia (366,200), Kenya (95,300) and Sudan (379,700).",http://reporting.unhcr.org/sites/default/files/UNHCR%20South%20Sudan%20Revised%20Supplementary%20Appeal%20Jan-Dec%202017%20--%20May%202017.pdf

The new arrivals joined more than 200,000 refugees from Myanmar already in the country, mainly in the District of Cox's Bazaar, bringing the total to approximately 900,000 With some 602,400 refugees in the Kutupalong-Balukhali site, it is now the largest refugee settlement in the world. The ""Rohingya refugee crisis"", as it is commonly referred to, has now slowed as compared with the pace and magnitude of 2017. Refugees are, however, still arriving from Myanmar into Bangladesh, some 3,236 in February 2018 alone. In line with the scenarios on the basis of which the Joint Response Plan has been elaborated, UNHCR's plans and activities to the end of 2018 are based on a total of 1.3 million people who will be in need of humanitarian assistance. This includes approximately 900,000 refugees in Cox’s Bazar; an estimated 80,000 additional refugees who may arrive in Bangladesh during the course of 2018; and some 336,000 people in the host community. In this Supplementary Appeal, UNHCR outlines its strategy, planning, operational and programmatic activities as part of that response, and for which the total financial requirement amounts to $238 million for 2018.

2018,South Sudan,SS,South Sudan,Supplementary Appeals,SPA,South Sudan - Responding to the needs of displaced South Sudanese and Refugees,"155,287,323",,,"The refugee exodus from South Sudan continues at an alarming rate, even as the crisis is entering its fifth year. Close to 2.4 million South Sudanese have fled to neighbouring countries mostly to Uganda—the largest host country in sub-Saharan Africa—followed by Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the Central African Republic (CAR). Refugees from South Sudan have been granted prima facie refugee status by these countries, demonstrating strong commitment to refugee protection despite limited national resources. While South Sudan’s neighbours have generously upheld their responsibility to provide asylum and assistance to refugees, urgent large-scale support is needed for the refugee response. With the current levels of violence in South Sudan, displacement trends are expected to be high both within the country and across the area covered by the situation. UNHCR expects that the influx into neighbouring countries will continue and that an estimated 571,000 additional people will likely seek refuge. This would bring the estimated South Sudanese refugee population to 3.1 million—an increase of 18 per cent—by the end of December 2018. This population is urgently in need of protection, shelter and medical care. In South Sudan itself, some two million IDPs and 307,000 non-South Sudanese refugees are expected to be in need of assistance. This would bring the total number of people of concern to UNHCR in South Sudan to 2.3 million by the end of December 2018.",http://reporting.unhcr.org/sites/default/files/UNHCR%20South%20Sudan%202018%20Supplementary%20Appeal_March%202018.pdf
